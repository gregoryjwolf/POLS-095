## Question 6: 50 pts. ##

# Before answering parts A, B, and C, include the line of code that sets your
# working directory and loads the packages you'll need for this assignment.

# Set working directory:


# Library packages



# 6A (10 pts.): Create a vector called your last name that has 10 numbers, some
# of which are repeating. Find the mean, median, and mode of thhat vector.

# mean:

# median:

# mode:


#6B (30 pts.): Create a new variable based on variable V202143 in the ANES dataset. 
# Variable 202143 is a feeling thermometer that guages attitudes towards Joe 
# Bide. Make sure you clean the dataset and variable by eliminating values of
# the variable that are not in the range (0-100) that pertains to the thermometer
# question. You should change those values so that they become "missing." Then, 
# find the mean, median, and mode of your new Biden feeling thermometer variable.

# tidyverse cleaning of data and V202143


# mean, median, and mode of new Biden feeling thermometer variable:


#6C (20 pts.): Create a histogram of the Biden feeling themometer variable and 
# then write a brief description (using a # to comment the line out) of what
# the distribution of the variable in the figure looks like. 



## Question 7: 15 pts. ##

# Upload your R script (this file to Blackboard). With the exception of the line
# that sets your working directory, I should be able to run the file error free.
